# Northwind-Traders-Challenge
In this project, I built a top-level KPI dashboard for Northwind Traders executive team that allows them to quickly understand the company's performance in key areas including; sales trends, product performance, key customers and shipping cost.

The dataset  used in this project contains sales and order data  for Northwind Traders, a fictitious gourmet food supplier. The data includes information about customers, products, orders, shippers and employees
I utilized calculated columns and measures to create visual cards for KPIs including; 
* Gross Revenue
* Total Discount
* Net Revenue
* Orders
* Units sold
* Number of customers
* Active products
* Discontinued products 

The report also shows Sales trend per year, key customers, top performing products and shipping costs
## Insights and Recommendations
* **Sale trends**: The company made the highest revenue in April which corresponds to 9.7% of the net revenue. The executive team should strive to understand the factors driving high sales in April and also develop effective sales and marketing strategies such as carrying out targeted monthly campaigns in order to replicate that success in other months.
* **Product Performance**: CÃ´te de Blaye being the top performing product and contributing 11.1% of the net revenue, the executive team should ensure there's adequate supply of this product to meet the demand. They should also focus on potentially expanding the product line to capitalize on its popularity.
* **Key customers**: QUICK- stop, Ernst Handel and Save-a-lot Markets being our key customers, they contribute significantly to the net revenue that is 8.68%, 8.26% and 8.21% respectively. The executive team should focus on understanding their needs and preferences, providing personalized services and implementing other strategies to ensure continued loyalty.  Prioritizing and maintaining strong relationships with these key customers will result in overall business growth due to customer retention.
* **Shipping cost**: The company is spending more on shipping using United Packages, It is essential to negotiate better rates with the carrier or evaluate alternative shipping options. This will help in optimizing shipping cost and reduce overall expenses.
