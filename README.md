# Northwind-Traders-Challenge
In this project, I built a top-level KPI dashboard for Northwind Traders executive team that allows them to quickly understand the company's performance in key areas including; sales trends, product performance, key customers and shipping cost.

The dataset  used in this project contains sales and order data  for Northwind Traders, a fictitious gourmet food supplier. The data includes information about customers, products, orders, shippers and employees
I utilized calculated columns and measures to create visual cards for KPIs including; 
* Gross Revenue
* Total Discount
* Net Revenue
* Orders
* Units sold
* Number of customers
* Active products
* Discontinued products 

The report also shows Sales trend per year, key customers, top performing products and shipping costs
